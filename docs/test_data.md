#### `opendsa` Database Test Data

The initial database population is defined by lib/tasks/sample_data.rake.
It uses the factories defined in spec/factories/* to generate entities.
If you add new model classes and want to generate test data in the
database, please add to the sample_data.rake file so that this population
will happen automatically for everyone.  The sample_data.rake contains
only "sample/try out" data for use during development, and it won't
appear on the production server.  Initial database contents provided
for all new installs, including the production server, is described
in db/seeds.rb instead.
