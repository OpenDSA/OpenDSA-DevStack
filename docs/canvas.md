#### Generate Canvas course using OpenDSA web interface.

1. After you are done you should have OpenDSA-LTI server running. Go to https://opendsa-lti.localhost.devcom.vt.edu to make sure your application is up and running.
2. Follow the instructions on the instructor's [guide page](https://opendsa-lti.localhost.devcom.vt.edu/home/guide) to set up your Canvas course. **Note:** skip the first step in this guide since you can use the **admin** account (admin@opendsa.org, pass: adminadmin) to cerate the course.
