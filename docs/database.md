#### Connect to Docker Container Database:

During development, it is convenient to connect to the `opendsa` database from your host machine using [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). Once you installed MySQL Workbench create a new connection to Vagrant VM Database using the following setup:

- Connection Name: OpenDSA-Devstack
- Connection Method: Standard TCP/IP
- MySQL Hostname: 127.0.0.1
- MySQL Server Port: 3307
- Username: root
- Password: opendsa
